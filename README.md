# 🐊 RNA-seq analysis workflow for non-lethal scute transcriptomics in *Crocodylus moreletii*

This repository contains the bioinformatic pipeline used to process and analyze RNA-seq data from *Crocodylus moreletii*, integrating transcriptomics tools for biomarker discovery.

## 🔬 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to identify molecular biomarkers associated with environmental stress in wild populations of *C. moreletii*. The analysis includes quality control, mapping, differential expression (DESeq2), functional enrichment (GSEA, GO/KEGG), Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) and biomarker selection by machine learning (ML).

### Repository scope
This repository contains the RNA-seq pipeline and scripts used for the transcriptomic analyses of *Crocodylus moreletii* (Publication 1).

*Note: Additional scripts for multiblock integration (mixOmics, coinertia, etc.) will be added in future publications once contaminant datasets become available.*
